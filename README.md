Common Programming Interview Questions
-------------------------------------------
This repo serves to provide solutions to interview questions that are often encountered during technical interviews. I've taken some from Facebook and other large companies - some are questions that I designed myself. 

The code seen here is meant to be accompanied by articles that can be found on my [technical blog](https://karansatia.com/blog). The articles will be posted in a series - each will begin with the title "Interview Question Practice Series Pt _"

The reasoning behind this was initially just to practice some algorithmic challenges. However, after trying to compare some of my solutions to what I found through research, I realized that plenty of these questions don't have any good answers online. The code that can be found is fragmented, untested and often doesn't follow the question to the letter. For example, if a question requires that the answer use constant space, every code solution will completely ignore that (crtical) piece of instruction.
